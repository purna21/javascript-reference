// *** What are Variables? *** //

/* 
Variables are a way for us to store different types of values in them.
They are like a container that holds values.

For a simple analogy, we put laptop in a bag. Here, bag is a Variable and
laptop is value.
*/


// *** Let's look at some code *** //

let name = 'Purna';
const age = 25;
let isMajor = true;

/* 
See in the above code, forget about the words like let and const. We will
discuss about them later. 

Just to clear, let and const are different ways how we declare a Variable.

Here name is the Variable name and 'Purna' is the value we stored in it.
Same goes for age and isMajor Variable. Left side we have Variable names and
Right side we store corresponding values.
*/

/*
We have console.log() method which shows the output in the Browser console.
*/

console.log(name);
console.log(age);
console.log(isMajor);
